# Zcelero Code Challenge

## Intro
Our new client is a prestigious blacksmith. He has an online order service that a freelancer built, but the back-end is unstable.
His customers are complaining, and he cannot contact his usual freelancer anymore. 

Therefore, he contacted us to improve the back end, making it more stable and maintainable.

## Constraints
You have a time constraint of 2 hours to complete this challenge.
Feel free to write down any further improvements if the time is not enough.
